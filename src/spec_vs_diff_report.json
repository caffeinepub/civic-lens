  "summary": "The diff provides only truncated evidence of footer changes. While a summary line claims the footer is “without watermark branding,” the actual footer JSX containing (or removing) the “Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai” text/link is not visible in the truncated AppLayout diff, so REQ-26 cannot be conclusively verified from the provided diff summary alone. Additionally, the diff includes unrelated project/documentation updates describing new authentication/password and workflow behaviors that were not requested.",

      "requirement": "Remove the bottom-of-page watermark/branding from the application footer by deleting the “Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai” text and the caffeine.ai outbound link so it no longer appears on any page.",
      "reason": "The only relevant code file (AppLayout.tsx) is truncated at the start of the footer, so the diff summary does not show the removal of the “caffeine.ai” text nor confirm the outbound link is gone. A separate text summary claims the footer has no watermark branding, but that is not direct code evidence of removal across all routes.",
