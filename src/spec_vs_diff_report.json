  "summary": "The diff updates the app to only show a password *verification* modal when a user already has a registered password and is not yet verified in-session, and it gates authenticated navigation/actions accordingly. It also removes/avoids any apparent password *registration* (“Create Your Password”) step in the shown code paths. However, the diff also includes documentation/summaries describing unrelated Google/Apple sign-in UI changes that were not requested.",
