      "id": "REQ-14",
      "text": "Remove the word \"SLA\" from all user-facing text across the Civic Lens website, while keeping the 72-hour deadline functionality intact and communicating the same concept using alternative wording (e.g., \"72-hour response window\", \"Deadline\", \"Time remaining\", \"Due by\").",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "No visible UI text contains the substring \"SLA\" (case-insensitive) on the landing page, dashboards, complaint lists, and complaint detail views.",
        "The landing page copy that currently says \"72-hour SLA\" / \"72-hour SLA guarantee\" is updated to an alternative phrase that does not include \"SLA\" (e.g., \"72-hour response window\").",
        "The complaint metadata label \"SLA Status\" is updated to an alternative label that does not include \"SLA\" (e.g., \"Deadline status\" or \"Response deadline\").",
        "The time remaining/overdue indicators continue to display as before (no changes to due dates, timers, escalation behavior, or status logic)."

    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do not change backend data fields (e.g., dueAt) or the 72-hour deadline/escalation logic; this is a terminology/copy-only change.",
    "Do not modify files under frontend/src/components/ui (compose existing components instead)."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Renaming internal component filenames/identifiers such as SlaBadge (only user-facing text must change).",
    "Changing the 72-hour deadline duration or how overdue/escalation is computed."
