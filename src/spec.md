# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the term “SLA” from all user-facing UI text across Civic Lens while preserving the existing 72-hour deadline behavior.

**Planned changes:**
- Update landing page marketing copy to replace phrases like “72-hour SLA” / “72-hour SLA guarantee” with equivalent wording (e.g., “72-hour response window”) without changing functionality.
- Replace user-visible labels such as “SLA Status” in complaint lists and complaint detail views with alternative labels (e.g., “Response deadline” / “Deadline status”).
- Ensure any other user-facing occurrences of “SLA” (case-insensitive) across landing page, dashboards, complaint lists, and complaint detail views are removed or reworded, without changing due dates, timers, escalation behavior, or status logic.

**User-visible outcome:** Users no longer see the word “SLA” anywhere in the UI, but still see the same 72-hour deadline information, time remaining/overdue indicators, and related behavior under updated terminology.
