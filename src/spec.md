# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove the footer watermark/branding text and outbound link referencing caffeine.ai from all pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Delete the “Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai” footer text.
- Remove the outbound link to https://caffeine.ai/ from the footer across all routes.
- Ensure the remaining footer content continues to render correctly without layout/alignment issues.

**User-visible outcome:** The application footer no longer shows any caffeine.ai branding or link, while the rest of the footer remains intact and readable on every page.
